# Weather-Report

This program Displays temperature and humidity readings on a web server using the ESP32 and rings alarm sound when temperature reaches above threshold level.

The goal of this experiment is to integrate the HTTP webserver with Sensor. As we know, most
IoT Nodes are equipped with sensors and the IoT systems should provide these sensor data to
users.Here I have used DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor connected to an
IoT Node/ ESP32 development board. The IoT Node is configured as a Webserver and the
sensor data can be accessed via a web browser. When the temperature value raises above Threshold temperature then the Buzzer rings.

**Harware Components Used -**
<br>ESP32, DHT 11 Sensor, Buzzer, Jumper wies, micro USB Cable

**OUTPUTS -**

**Serial Monitor** <br>
